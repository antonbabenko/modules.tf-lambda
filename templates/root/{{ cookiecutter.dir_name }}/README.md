## Getting started

These configurations are **potentially** working out of the box but it is very likely that you will want to customize parameters.

Make sure that you install these tools:

- Terraform 0.11.7 or newer
- Terragrunt 0.14.7 or newer

Optional dependencies:

- pre-commit

## How it works?

Infrastructure consists of multiple layers (eg, autoscaling, rds, s3) where each layer is configured using exactly one [Terraform AWS modules](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/) with the values specified in `terraform.tfvars` located in layer's directory.

Run this command to create or update infrastructure in all layers:

    $ terragrunt apply-all

Alternatively you can work on a single layer at the time:

    $ cd eu-west-1/elb   # for example
    $ terragrunt apply

See [Terragrunt documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/blob/master/README.md) for more details about commands and workflow.
